# UWPConceptDesign

Some of the UI are made just looks pretty, and can not be used in production.

This is due to UWP limitations, and this is also `Flutter`'s most proudable. Yes, it's `Widget`. In `Flutter`, everything can be widget, so we can make everything we want.

But in UWP, Microsoft has made rules, we can't change some of the rules, so some of the concept designs I made, are coded in various forms. Like desktop context menu, due to system `ContextFlyout`'s limitation, we can't customize the style. So I had to remake by a window.

Concepts are from https://twitter.com/zeealeid

## Desktop context menu 

I didn't use `ContextFlyout` because it can not be customized.
